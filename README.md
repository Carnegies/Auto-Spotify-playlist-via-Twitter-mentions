# Auto generated Spotify playlist via Twitter mentions

This is a basic script that allows you to add spotify tracks to your playlist based on twitter mentions. If the tweet contains a direct link to a track or the tracks Spotify URI it will add it to the playlist of choice. It will keep track of duplicates but other restraints can be implemented.

# Videos to watch first
You will need to understand these videos first and install the API's. You will also need to make an account at <a href ="https://developer.twitter.com/">Twitter for developers</a> and <a href ="https://developer.spotify.com/">Spotify for developers</a>.

# Videos tutorial
I also made a basic <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmt5SdvTqUI">video</a> explaning what the project does but I did not go into details about the actuall scrip. As I said in the video my original folder did also include 3 folders named node_modules, __pycache__ and Spotify, plus a file named "cookies.pkl". I assume these are auto genreted when you run one of the API's (probably Spotipy) but since it was some time I made this I did not remember how they came there but I'm sure you can figure it out.

# Last notes
Make sure to fill out the "key.py" and "keys_spotify" with the correct information in order to set this up correctly.
